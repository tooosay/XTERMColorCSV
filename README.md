# XTERMColorCSV [![img][pbd]]
XTermcolor table in CSV format. If you want to use this in a python program, please copy and paste a specific dictionary from dict.py, or you can generate a dict from CSV file.
Note: 256color.csv is a CSV I generated for a python dictionary.
xtermcolor.csv is generated by [jabbalaci](https://github.com/jabbalaci/ClosestX11Color/blob/master/colors.csv) , but I changed a little (only three colors of hls)
